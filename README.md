# Mj√∂lnir - the ban hammer.

Adds easy ban summary reporting to the International PHP Facebook group. The script is not related to Facebook nor PHP itself by any means. It is left aside whether or not there is any relationship with Thor, the Norwegian mythical god, and/or his awesome hammer.

## Minimum requirements
- A modern browser
- A userscript engine (a.k.a. Greasemonkey plug-in)
- Being worthy

## Status
This project is still in it's experimental phase, hence the brief README.
